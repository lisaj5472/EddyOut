## Description

Plan smarter. Paddle better.

EDDYOUT is a full-stack web application built for outdoor adventurers and river trip organizers who want to streamline multi-day trip planning. From crew management to gear checklists and meal assignments, EDDYOUT centralizes the logistics so you can focus on the fun partâ€”getting on the water. EDDYOUT was built to centralize planning, improve commmunication, and support our outdoor communities. IYKYK, those shared spreadsheets that Trip Leader sends around will 'do the job' but nobody really likes them and we're here to find a better way.
